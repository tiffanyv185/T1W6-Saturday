# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday Class

## If - Else Practice Activitiy 
Build a calcultor that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers (float) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perfom

# Lists
Composite data type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops
Run away, but we're running in circles.
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until  a certain condition is met.

Dry Coding principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

'If' condition could decide whether or not to run the intended block. whereas,
Loops would decide how many times the user wants to run the intended block

# While Loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block.

Things to consider:
* program can enter the loop
* program can exit the loop

## Range
It a pre-defined function that generates a sequence of numbers.

Useful: loops for interating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers.

range(starting, stopping, step)

# For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended statements.

for variable_name in sequence:
    state

## Practice
Finding the sum of the first 10 numbers (1,2,3,4,..,10)

## Practice
Finding the largest number in the list
list = [1, 55, 22, 28, 93, 11, 33, 36, 32]


# Loop control statements
Control the flow of the loop, terminate the loop early if you want or skip over some iteration

* Break statement
Terminate loop immediately, moves to the next statement after the loop.

* Continue statement
Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
